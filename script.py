"""
each directory on a line will go into the parent folder
! - Used at the start of a directory. Any following directory will be created
    inside of this directory unless a '?' is used.
    eg: !ParentFolder
? - Represents the closing of a parent directory (go back up 1 directory)
    eg: !ParentFolder !ChildFolder ? !SecondChild ? ?
& - Command to start an iteration of numbers appended to the end of a folder name
    eg: &Folder-0-12 => will iterate from 0 to 12 folders starting
    with Folder0 and ending at Folder12.
    Use a '-' to separate starting and ending iterations.
$ - Represents a space " "
    eg: My$Pictures == My Pictures
